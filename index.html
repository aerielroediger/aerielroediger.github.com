            	<h1>About Me</h1>
                <p><img src="images/photo.png" alt="photo" class="alignleft">I am a twenty-four year old self taught graphic designer from California with a lifelong passion for art in all of it's forms.</p>
                <p>I specialize primarily in digital illustration and graphic design, but I have experience in a broad range of disciplines from concepting, storyboarding, and even web design. In addition, I have also been both participant and head organizer of a number of small independant projects, which has given me invaluable experience in both project management and being a member of a creative team.</p>
                <p>Currently, I work on a number of freelancing gigs of varying types. If you are interested, please follow the links below for how to contact me.</p>
